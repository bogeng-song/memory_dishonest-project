# memory_dishonest-project
## Script:
1. corr_lierate_emotion.ipynb: calculate the correlation between the liarate and emotion and behavoir performance drop, and plot the heatmap figure for correlation and save the correlation matrix. And mediation analysis is also included.
2. emotion_compare_plot.ipynb: plot the emotion comparison figure, including the mean and standard deviation of each emotion, and save the figure.
3. corr_hddm_emotion.ipynb: calculate the correlation between the emotion and hddm parameters, and plot the heatmap figure

## Results:
correlation result summary folder: 
1. reward_, punishement_, mixed_corr.xlsx: save the r value for heatmap figure from the script corr_lierate_emotion.ipynb
2. reward_, punishement_, mixed_pvalue.xlsx: save the p value for heatmap figure from the script corr_lierate_emotion.ipynb
3. hddm_corr_value, hddm_pvalue.xlsx: save the r value and p value for heatmap figure from the script corr_hddm_emotion.ipynb
